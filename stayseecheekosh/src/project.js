    "inspo": "I've always seen similar toys for babies, however never played. After doing a little reasearch I realized the toy I saw? not related and not for babies. I also found out Tower of Hanoi has been around since 1883! So I decided to make an application after becoming invested.",
    "challenges": "First I had to figure out how to play the game! The idea to drag and drop a disk felt natural. Which lead me to multple challenges to overcome. Some of the hurdles I had to get over include making disk draggable when needed and having disk drop on to other disk. I learned a minimum of three things are happening when we drag and drop items on a page: first the item must react to drag start, on drag over, and finally when the object is 'dropped'.",

    "challenges": "First I had to figure out how to play the game! The idea to drag and drop a disk felt natural. Which lead me to multple challenges to overcome. Some of the hurdles I had to get over include making disk draggable when needed and having disk drop on to other disk. I learned a minimum of three things are happening when we drag and drop items on a page: first the item must react to drag start, on drag over, and finally when the object is 'dropped'.",

# Stacey Csikos' Portfolio

Hello! Welcome to my repo for my portfolio. It's always changing :) I'm proud of the dynamic rendering I've got going on here as it will help me from going into many files and changing information. Whenever I want to add a new project I only have to touch one file. I tried really hard to find a form that would keep the user on the page, without having to make a backend, and thanks to [Form Submit](https://formsubmit.co) I could! Looking forward to adding more projects and making this portfolio look more creative. Thanks for reading üë©‚Äçüíª
